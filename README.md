# FirefoxQ-BlueSteel
My current firefox setup on Manjaro KDE Plasma, as of Thanksgiving 2018. Includes .css/as.css/.js/uc.js/xml

My take on firefox quantum. I am the first to admit that not all of the modifications/implimentations I have made are the most efficient or productive. However, they are nice and gaudy and bright - What can I say? I operate out of the id. 

Anyway, this repository is made for personal use and I am cool with/encourage any adaptations/bastardizations of it. Included with the css is a sereis of files that allow for jscrpt capabilitites. They will be set within their own folder. Otherwise, files will be primarily separated by css/as.css vs. js/uc.js. 

Also, don't forget the bindings.xml doc as well. userChrome.css will dictate some rules in the beginning of the file that grant the as.css and uc.js capabilities. Any docs involving quantum that are not included here will be located in the 2 repositories re firefox. 


In sum, the overall look and feel of my entire Firefos Quantum Setup is as folows:

- bottom toolbar added so as to maintain all of my addons (only 2 specific ones located near urlbar)
- TabsToolbar auto-hide under the navbar. 
- TabsToolbar tabs only show the tab icon image; no text or label/description
- Tabs, by default, are on grayscale; only the currently selected tabs shows up in color
- Tabs are shrunk accordingly to their new size;
- Hovering over tabs will also display the color of the icon.
- Bookmarks toolbar is currently not activated in my setup, as of now. I initially put it to the right of the urlbar and limited the shrinking of the urlbar (you know, when you add more bookmarks) by adding a max-width. However, I don't really like that look, so I am trying to figure something else out, and decided to remove it in the meantime. 
- There is an issue with the context menu and [I think] the dialog menus. They seem to be transparent. I think this is a mistake on my part of the Win10.as.css file located in this repository. 
    - NOTE: If anyone can help/give me advice on how to configure the context menu so that when you hover it and/or when you use the keyboard to selected an item (but before you enable it/push enter), instead of a background highlight and text change, only the color of the text changes (e.g. minty green, to purple when selected/hovered). Thanks in advance!
    
    
Well, I think that about sums it up. If it hasn't been readily apprent already, I am an absolute novie when it comes to coding, of any variety. I began learning right when firefox quantum came out, and my time on r/firefoxcss, as well as countless other websites when looking for those tough to find answers (e.g. stackoverflow, superuser, etc) has taught me literally everything I know. 

As for any JS stuff, I can't write it for shit, but I do get the general idea of how it works just from using it alongside the css files. That, and messing around with Foobar2000, but that is a whole other can of worms. 

Hope you guys like it. Any and all feedback/criticism is not only welcomed, but encouraged.
