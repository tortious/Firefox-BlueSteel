# FirefoxQ-BlueSteel
My current firefox setup on Manjaro KDE Plasma, as of Thanksgiving 2018. Includes .css/as.css/.js/uc.js/xml

My take on firefox quantum. I am the first to admit that not all of the modifications/implimentations I have made are the most efficient or productive. However, they are nice and gaudy and bright - What can I say? I operate out of the id. 

Anyway, this repository is made for personal use and I am cool with/encourage any adaptations/bastardizations of it. Included with the css is a sereis of files that allow for jscrpt capabilitites. They will be set within their own folder. Otherwise, files will be primarily separated by css/as.css vs. js/uc.js. 

Also, don't forget the bindings.xml doc as well. userChrome.css will dictate some rules in the beginning of the file that grant the as.css and uc.js capabilities. Any docs involving quantum that are not included here will be located in the 2 repositories re firefox.
